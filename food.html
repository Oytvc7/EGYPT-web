            <h2>Kushari</h2>
            <p>
                Koshari is one of the most popular Egyptian dishes. It 
                consists of pasta, rice, black lentils, fried onions, and tomato sauce, which is hot and
                fried tomatoes. Koshari is considered a low-cost, high-calorie dish with oxidized vegetable
                oils due to frying, which raises a lot of health 
                criticism about the meal and the like

            <h2>Ful w Taameya</h2>
            <p>Ta'ameya (Egyptian falafel) is an all-time favorite street food in Egypt. In most parts of the Middle East, falafel is made with ground chickpeas. In Egypt however, we make it with dried fava beans. These are best served with pita bread, tomato, onions, and tahini sauce
